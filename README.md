# dominos

This is a simple game demo.
The one and only idea for now is to arrange dominoes in order to collapse each one of them by pushing the first one down.

Demo is made in three.js using physi.js physics.
Featured options include: changing domino textures, deleting dominos, selecting which domino to crash first...
The sound is added on collision, and also collision detection is preventing dominoes to be placed one over each other.

Future plans are to ad more objects next to dominoes that can collapse each other, like: mini cars. balls, ballons...
Also the posibility to choose background and floor textures and background music. To add more floor levels etc...
