# dominos

This is a simple game demo.

The one and only idea for now is to arrange dominos in order to collapse each one of them by pushing the first one down.

Demo is made in three.js using physi.js physics and is loosely based on a demo from the book "Learning Three.js The JavaScript 3D Library for WebGL - Second Edition" written by Jos Dirksen and it's chapter 12, example 1 "basic scene". 

Featured options include: placing domino on selected location, selecting placed domino in order to rotate it, change its texture, delete it or choose which domino to crash first...

The sound is added on collision, and also collision detection is preventing dominos to be placed one over each other.

Future plans are to add more objects next to dominos that can collapse each other, like: mini cars. balls, ballons...
Also the possibility to choose background and floor textures and background music. To add more floor levels etc...
